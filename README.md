## Processing Clickable Elements

Processing Clickable Elements is a library which proviedes the user with simple and intuitive methods to check whether or not a text or image element has been click/hovered over

As of right now, the library is in beta, and is not yet complete. However in the coming days I will be adding documentation, and hopefully creaing the first release of this library.
